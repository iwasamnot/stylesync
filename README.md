## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

Firebase is already configured with the following services:
- **Authentication**: Ready for user sign-in/sign-up
- **Firestore**: Database for products and user data
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking

Configuration file: `src/lib/firebase.js`

### Admin Account Setup

To create an admin account, see the detailed guide in [ADMIN_SETUP.md](./ADMIN_SETUP.md).

**Quick Steps:**
1. Create a user account through the app
2. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
3. Find the `users` collection and locate the user document (by UID)
4. Update the `role` field from `"user"` to `"admin"`

### Firestore Security Rules

Security rules are defined in `firestore.rules`. Deploy them with:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Key Rules:**
- **Users**: Can read own data; admins can read/write all
- **Products**: Everyone can read; only admins can create/update/delete
- **Orders**: Users can read own orders; admins can read/write all

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automatic Deployment via GitHub Actions

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys to Firebase Hosting whenever you push code to the `main` branch.

#### Setup (One-time)

1. **Generate Firebase Service Account Token**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Select your project: `stylesync-sistc`
   - Go to Project Settings → Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate New Private Key"
   - Save the JSON file (keep it secure!)

2. **Add Secret to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/iwasamnot/stylesync`
   - Navigate to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   - Value: Paste the entire contents of the JSON file you downloaded
   - Click "Add secret"

3. **Push to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   The workflow will automatically trigger and deploy your site!

#### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. **Login to Firebase** (first time only):
   ```bash
   npx firebase login
   ```
   This will open a browser window for authentication.

2. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx firebase deploy --only hosting
   ```

### Live Site URLs

Once deployed, your site will be available at:
- https://stylesync-sistc.web.app
- https://stylesync-sistc.firebaseapp.com

**Note**: Firebase Hosting configuration files:
- `firebase.json` - Hosting configuration
- `.firebaserc` - Project ID configuration
- `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
